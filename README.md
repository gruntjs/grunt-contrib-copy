# grunt-contrib-copy [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-copy.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-copy)

> Copy files and folders.


## Getting Started
If you haven't used [grunt][] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][] guide, as it explains how to create a [gruntfile][Getting Started] as well as install and use grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-contrib-copy --save-dev
```

[grunt]: http://gruntjs.com/
[Getting Started]: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/devel/docs/getting_started.md


## Copy task
_Run this task with the `grunt copy` command._

_This task is a [multi task][] so any targets, files and options should be specified according to the [multi task][] documentation._
[multi task]: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki/Configuring-tasks


### Options

#### cwd
Type: `String`

This option sets the current working directory for use with the minimatch and copy process. This helps translate paths when copied so that the destination stucture matches the source structure exactly. Without a `cwd` set, all paths are relative to the gruntfile directory which can cause extra depth to be added to your copied structure when it may not be desired.

When copying to a directory you must add a trailing slash to the destination due to added support of single file copy.

```js
copy: {
  target: {
    options: {
      cwd: 'path/to/sources'
    },
    files: {
      'tmp/test/': ['*', 'sub1/*']
    }
  }
}
```

#### excludeEmpty
Type: `Boolean`
Default: false

This option excludes empty folders from being copied to the destination directory.

#### flatten
Type: `Boolean`
Default: false

This option performs a flat copy that dumps all the files into the root of the destination directory, overwriting files if they exist.

#### processName
Type: `Function`

This option accepts a function that adjusts the filename of the copied file. Function is passed filename and should return a string.

```js
options: {
  processName: function(filename) {
    if (filename == "test.jpg") {
      filename = "newname.jpg";
    }
    return filename;
  }
}
```

#### processContent
Type: `Function`

This option is passed to `grunt.file.copy` as an advanced way to control the file contents that are copied.

#### processContentExclude
Type: `String`

This option is passed to `grunt.file.copy` as an advanced way to control which file contents are processed.

#### minimatch
Type: `Object`

These options will be forwarded on to expandFiles, as referenced in the [minimatch options section](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch/#options)

### Usage Examples

```js
copy: {
  dist: {
    files: {
      "path/to/directory/": "path/to/source/*", // includes files in dir
      "path/to/directory/": "path/to/source/**", // includes files in dir and subdirs
      "path/to/project-<%= pkg.version %>/": "path/to/source/**", // variables in destination
      "path/to/directory/": ["path/to/sources/*.js", "path/to/more/*.js"], // include JS files in two diff dirs
      "path/to/filename.ext": "path/to/source.ext"
    }
  }
}
```
